## Artizanya: Cafe in the Future

Artizanya is a small family cafe from the second half of the 22<sup>nd</sup>
century, where the means of production belong to individual artizans, and large
corporations are engaged in fundamental research for the benefit of all
mankind. The results of fundamental research are publicly available for artisans
to search for their interesting applications.

In the cafe, 3D printers from the beginning of the 21st century are still
working. You can see with your own eyes how the artisan movement was born at the
beginning of its journey and drink delicious coffee made according to old
recipes - without a matter synthesizer.

Over the decades, many old newspapers and visitor notes have accumulated in the
cafe. The new generation of cafe owners gradually organizes old news into an
archive and posts them on their website in the news section...

## Artizanya: Platform and Community

Artizanya is the first Distributed Fabrication (DFab) platform!

DFab is not a replacement or a competitor of the conventional manufacturers and
factories. Its aim is not to reduce product prices, to boost production volume
or to make products more convenient or outstanding on the market.

DFab is about creating a community of people who are not happy to be “satisfied
customers”. Who want to participate in creation of the products they use. To
understand how things work and how they are made. Who want to make their
contribution as “satisfied co-creators”!

Any high-tech product, after all, is not just a tool or convenience utility. It
is a portal into a another dimension of our reality – an invitation to venture
to that unexplored dimension to discover new experiences and develop new
understandings.
