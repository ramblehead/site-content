  Self-hosted wildcard DNS configuration example with multiple servers on a single IP
  with similar port numbers (e.g. multiple https on different subdomains) and SSL
  termination with a single certificate for all hosted servers.

## Priming

This configuration example was tested on Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), but should be
compatible with any Debian-based Linux.

For serving multi-tenant self-hosted applications with a single SSL certificate
it is possible to use a DNS provider that supports the following features:

 * Dynamic DNS
 * Wildcard Subdomain Addresses
 * DNS-01 challenge API [supported by Lego](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/)

Dynamic DNS configuration process has been described in [Dynamic
DNS](/blog/dynamic-dns) post.

Wildcard Subdomain Address and DNS-01 challenge configurations are closely
related subjects. Therefore their configurations are both described in the
current post.

However Google Domains is used here as an example, for the new deployments
Google Domains may not be used as it [will no longer
offer](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/13689670?authuser=0&hl=en-GB)
new domain registrations.

[nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) web server is used as a reverse proxy and as SSL
termination. [LEGO](https://github.com/go-acme/lego) (Let's Encrypt client and
ACME library written in Go) is used to obtain SSL certificates and
keys. [systemd
timer](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.timer.html)
is used to automate SSL certificates and keys renewals before they expire.

For simplicity it is assumed that all software are running on the same server
(Raspberry Pi in my case).

## Mock web-server and error page

For the purpose of this SSL configuration example, it is assumed that that the
host is already running a web-server such as Next.js at the following address:

[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

It is also assumed that there is a static HTML page on the host file system that
holds page not found error:

```
/path/to/errors/404.html
```

I might write another post on setting-up Next.js 14 as a web server and as a
static pages generator if there is a need for such instructions.

## Configuring Router Port Forwarding

Port forwarding configuration depends on the Internet provider and the router
used. In this post, it is assumed that ports `80` and `443` are forwarded to the
similar ports and to the internal IP address that runs nginx server.


## Installing LEGO

Refer to your DNS provider documentation and to LEGO DNS Providers
[documentation](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/) to configure wildcard
subdomain addresses DNS and to obtain API key for DNS-01 challenge.

At the time of writing, LEGO is relatively new, and the versions included with
most Linux distributions are not up-to-date with the current release. The best
way to obtain the latest version is to compile it from the source. LEGO is
written in Golang and requires a fairly recent version of Golang, which might
not be available in a Linux distribution.

To compile LEGO from the source, Golang can be installed from its original
binary distribution by following the [official
instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install).

With Golang installed, LEGO can be [built and
installed](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/installation/) with the following
command:

```
# go1.17+
# environment variable: GO111MODULE=on
go install github.com/go-acme/lego/v4/cmd/lego@latest
```

## Getting SSL keys and certificates using LEGO

The following command is an example of how LEGO may be used for DNS-01 challenge
and wildcard subdomain:

```
lego --accept-tos \
     --dns=googledomains \
     --domains='artizanya.com' \
     --domains='*.artizanya.com' \
     --email='rh@artizanya.com' \
     run
```

## Installing and Configuring Nginx

```
sudo nginx -t
```

```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

```
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  server_name *.artizanya.com;

  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl default_server;
  listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;

  ssl_certificate /home/rh/tsl/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /home/rh/tsl/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.key;
  ssl_trusted_certificate /home/rh/tsl/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.issuer.crt;
  include /home/rh/tsl/nginx-letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
  ssl_dhparam /home/rh/tsl/nginx-letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

  server_name *.artizanya.com;

  root /home/rh/artizanya/packages/wui-errors/out;
  # index index.html;
  index 404.html;

  # location / {
  #   proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
  #   proxy_http_version 1.1;
  #   proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  #   proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
  #   proxy_set_header Host $host;
  #   proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  # }
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  listen [::]:443 ssl;

  ssl_certificate /home/rh/tsl/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /home/rh/tsl/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.key;
  ssl_trusted_certificate /home/rh/tsl/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.issuer.crt;
  include /home/rh/tsl/nginx-letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
  ssl_dhparam /home/rh/tsl/nginx-letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

  server_name artizanya.com;

  # if_modified_since off;
  # add_header Last-Modified "";

  # add_header Cache-Control no-cache;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```
