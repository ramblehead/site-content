## Priming

This configuration example was tested on Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), but should be
compatible with any Debian-based Linux.

For serving multi-tenant self-hosted applications with a single SSL certificate
one might use a DNS provider that supports the following features:

 * Dynamic DNS
 * Wildcard Subdomain Addresses
 * DNS-01 challenge API [supported by Lego](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/)

Dynamic DNS configuration process has been described in [Dynamic
DNS](/blog/dynamic-dns) article.

Wildcard Subdomain Address and DNS-01 challenge configurations are closely
related subjects. Therefore their configurations are both described in the
current article.

However Google Domains is used here as an example, for the new deployments
Google Domains may not be used as it [will no longer
offer](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/13689670?authuser=0&hl=en-GB)
new domain registrations.

[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) is used as a reverse proxy and as SSL
termination.<br />
[LEGO](https://github.com/go-acme/lego) is used for obtaining SSL certificates
and keys.<br />
[systemd timer](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.timer.html)
is used to automate SSL certificates and keys renewals before they expire.

For simplicity it is assumed that all software are running on the same host
(Raspberry Pi 4 in my case).

## Mock web-server and error page

For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that that the host is already
running a web-server such as Next.js at the following address:

[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

It is also assumed that there is a static HTML page on the host file system that
holds page not found error. For example:

```
/home/rh/artizanya-host/packages/wui-errors/out/404.html
```

(I might write another article on setting-up Next.js 14 as a web server and as a
static pages generator if there is a need for such guidelines.)

## Configuring Router Port Forwarding

The configuration of port forwarding depends on the Internet provider and the
router in use. In this article, it is assumed that ports `80` and `443` are
forwarded to the corresponding ports at the internal IP address running the
NGINX server.


## Installing and Configuring LEGO

Refer to your DNS provider documentation and to [LEGO DNS Providers
documentation](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/) to configure wildcard
subdomain addresses and to obtain API key for DNS-01 challenge.

At the time of writing, LEGO is relatively new, and the versions included with
most Linux distributions are not up-to-date with the current release. The best
way to obtain the latest version is to compile it from the source. LEGO is
written in Golang and requires a fairly recent version of Golang, which might
not be available in a Linux distribution.

To compile LEGO from the source, Golang can be installed from its original
binary distribution by following [the official
instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install).

With Golang installed, LEGO can be [built and
installed](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/installation/#from-sources) using the
following command:

```shell
$ # go1.17+
$ # environment variable: GO111MODULE=on
$ go install github.com/go-acme/lego/v4/cmd/lego@latest
```

## Getting SSL Keys and Certificates Using LEGO

The following command is an example of how LEGO may be used for DNS-01 challenge
and wildcard subdomain:

```shell
$ # environment variable: GOOGLE_DOMAINS_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
$ cd /home/rh/artizanya-host
$ lego --accept-tos \
       --dns=googledomains \
       --domains='artizanya.com' \
       --domains='*.artizanya.com' \
       --email='rh@artizanya.com' \
       run
```

## Getting NGINX files required for Let's Encrypt SSL

The following commands could be used to obtain NGINX files required for Let's
Encrypt SSL:

```shell
$ cd /home/rh/artizanya-host
$ mkdir -pv nginx/letsencrypt && cd nginx/letsencrypt
$ wget --backups=1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/_internal/tls_configs/options-ssl-nginx.conf
$ wget --backups=1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot/certbot/ssl-dhparams.pem
```


## Installing and Configuring NGINX

NGINX configuration file for `artizanya.com`:

```nginxconf
# /home/rh/artizanya-host/nginx/sites-available/artizanya.com

server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;

  server_name *.artizanya.com;

  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl default_server;
  listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;

  ssl_certificate /home/rh/artizanya-host/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /home/rh/artizanya-host/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.key;
  ssl_trusted_certificate /home/rh/artizanya-host/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.issuer.crt;
  include /home/rh/artizanya-host/nginx/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
  ssl_dhparam /home/rh/artizanya-host/nginx/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

  server_name *.artizanya.com;

  root /home/rh/artizanya-host/packages/wui-errors/out;
  index 404.html;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  listen [::]:443 ssl;

  ssl_certificate /home/rh/artizanya-host/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /home/rh/artizanya-host/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.key;
  ssl_trusted_certificate /home/rh/artizanya-host/.lego/certificates/artizanya.com.issuer.crt;
  include /home/rh/artizanya-host/nginx/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
  ssl_dhparam /home/rh/artizanya-host/nginx/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

  server_name artizanya.com;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```

To enable above NGINX configuration:

```shell
$ ln -s /home/rh/artizanya-host/nginx/sites-available/artizanya.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

The following command can be used to verify NGINX configuration:

```shell
# nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

To reload NGINX after configuration change:

```shell
# systemctl reload nginx
```

To view NGINX available output:

```shell
$ journalctl -u dns01_challenge.service
```

To follow NGINX current output:

```shell
$ journalctl --no-pager --follow -u nginx
```

## Installing and Configuring systemd LEGO timer

The following bash, service and timer files are required to execute LEGO on
systemd timer:

```bash
# /home/rh/artizanya-host/utils/dns01_challenge.sh

cd ..

ACTION=run
if [ -f .lego/certificates/artizanya.com.crt ]; then
  ACTION=renew
fi

lego --accept-tos \
     --dns=googledomains \
     --domains='artizanya.com' \
     --domains='*.artizanya.com' \
     --email='rh@artizanya.com' \
     "${ACTION}"

systemctl reload nginx
```

```ini
# /home/rh/artizanya-host/systemd/dns01_challenge.timer

[Unit]
Description=Run Artizanya dns-01_challenge.service every 2 months

[Timer]
Unit=dns01_challenge.service
# Run on the 7th day of every odd month
OnCalendar=*-01,03,05,07,09,11-07 00:00:00 UTC
# or run every 2 months
# OnCalendar=*-*-1/2 00:00:00 UTC
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```ini
# /home/rh/artizanya-host/systemd/dns01_challenge.service

[Unit]
Description=Execute dns01_challenge.sh script

[Service]
Type=oneshot
WorkingDirectory=/home/rh/artizanya-host
EnvironmentFile=/home/rh/artizanya-host/.env
Environment=PATH=/home/rh/go/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
ExecStart=/home/rh/artizanya-host/utils/dns01_challenge.sh
```

`.env` file referred by service option `EnvironmentFile` should contain
environment variable `GOOGLE_DOMAINS_ACCESS_TOKEN` (see [LEGO DNS Providers
documentation](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/) for the environment
variables required by LEGO for your DNS provider).

To enable above service and timer:

```shell
# systemctl enable /home/rh/artizanya-host/systemd/dns01_challenge.service
# systemctl enable --now /home/rh/artizanya-host/systemd/dns01_challenge.timer
```

To make timer targets to wait until real time is initialised on systems with no
real time clock (such as Raspberry Pi 4):

```shell
# systemctl enable --now systemd-time-wait-sync.service
```

To reload systemd after changing enabled service and timer files:


```shell
# systemctl daemon-reload
```
