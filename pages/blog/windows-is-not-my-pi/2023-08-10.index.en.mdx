## TL;DR

Use
[rpi4-ethernet-over-usb](https://github.com/ramblehead/rpi4-ethernet-over-usb)
bash scripts to configure local Ethernet-over-USB on Raspberry Pi 4.

## Priming

When using Raspberry Pi 4 as an embedded system on devices, it is convenient to
have a web server as the device user interface. Modern browsers expose sufficient
functionality for web apps to perform on par with desktop and mobile
applications. This type of Web User Interface (WUI) deployment is particularly
attractive due to its unmatched cross-platform compatibly, no installation
requirements and, potentially, zero configuration.

While Raspberry Pi 4 has Ethernet interface and it is fairly easy to configure
on TCP/IP networks, it might still be challenging for an end user to connect it
to their computer or an existing network. The recurring problem is the static IP
versus DHCP configuration.

If a device with embedded Raspberry Pi 4 is deployed using default DHCP client
configuration, the end user could expect it to work when connected directly to
the computer Ethernet port. It would, of course, fail as most personal computers
are also by default configured as DHCP clients.

## Motivation

A seemingly simple solution is to provide the end user with instructions of how
to configure their computer Ethernet adapter with a static IP address and also
configure embedded Raspberry Pi 4 with static IP. Such configuration should work
with direct connection between Raspberry Pi and a user computer.  Unfortunately,
it would also fail when connecting to an existing network with DHCP server.
Additionally, user's computer would no longer work with networks that are
running DHCP server.

Well, static IP addresses would work in *some* networks with DHCP server and
some more secure networks can be configured to allow certain static IP
addresses. That, however, only adds more complexity to an already complex
configuration problem.

Another solution to this network configuration issue could be adding a small
display to Raspberry Pi with some buttons to switch between static and dynamic
IP address configurations, provide some connection diagnostics indicators and to
allow users to manually set custom static IP address. In many cases this solution
is less desirable as it increases device cost and complexity, and it is also no
longer zero-configuration device.

Yet another solution could be providing an Ethernet router along with the device
to allow user's computer and Raspberry Pi to be both configured as DHCP
clients. This might be a good solution if there are multiple devices that should
be connected to the network simultaneously, and also if the devices are large
and expensive enough in compare to the size and cost of the router. In other
cases, this solution is less good. Additionally, routers require a separate
power supply.

One more solution could be connecting an additional Ethernet adapter to
Raspberry Pi as a USB dongle or a HAT. Then the native Ethernet port can be
configured as DHCP client and the external Ethernet as static IP. Thus, the
native Ethernet port can be connected to a network with DHCP server and the
external Ethernet port can be used to connect Raspberry Pi directly to user's
computer. Unfortunately, apart from an extra cost this solution would introduce
an additional confusion - which port is which, and it does not eliminate the
need of user's computer configuration with static IP address.

## Ethernet-over-USB

It seems that there is no good way of configuring Raspberry Pi 4 Ethernet
adapter as a mean to provide zero configuration device WUI. Alternative approach
could be to use USB interface for direct computer connection and to reserve
Ethernet for networks with DHCP server.

### Simple Configuration from Pi Zero

In order to access device WUI via USB, the USB driver should support some kind
of Ethernet-over-USB bridging. Linux kernel
[supports](https://docs.kernel.org/usb/gadget_configfs.html) such capability,
known as "USB gadget", for more than a decade. A brief internet search reveals
that some more recent Raspberry Pi devices allow such USB configuration&nbsp;-
including Raspberry Pi 4. Many internet forums and posts seem to suggest
configuration that was originally
[used](https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget)
on Pi Zero devices. On Pi 4, it should be used with USB-C port that is also
normally used for power. This configuration is very simple:

* On Pi 4, add `dtoverlay=dwc2` line to the end of `/boot/config.txt` file.
* Add `modules-load=dwc2,g_ether` string after `rootwait` in
  `/boot/cmdline.txt`.

Unfortunately, on my Ubuntu 22.04 LTS systems it only works with "Link-Local
Only" enabled:

Windows 10 and Windows 11 recognise such USB configuration as COM port:

### Ben Hardill's Configuration

Further internet search has revealed an excellent blog
[post](https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/) by Ben
Hardill. The configuration Ben proposes is more involved, but it demonstrates
how to setup kernel's `usb_gadget`, including USB device descriptor, from shell
and how DHCP server can be used at Raspberry Pi side, so the host computer does
not require setting IP address manually. In my tests, Ben's configuration worked
perfectly well on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. However, Windows 10 and Windows 11 still
recognised it as a COM port.

### Ramblehead's Configuration

Unfortunately, Windows support is important. Also, I would prefer to have
`systemd` configuration over using `/etc/rc.local`. So, I started working on my
own solution based on Ben's work. Further Windows-specific internet search has
revealed
[this](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/netchip-rndisethernet-gadget-not-detected-on/9dfdd348-f503-47be-9c72-87736fb771a6)
and
[that](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-10-vs-remote-ndis-ethernet-usbgadget-not/cb30520a-753c-4219-b908-ad3d45590447)
threads on Microsoft answers forum. Reading those threads led me to another
brilliant project from LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 community:
[ev3-systemd](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3-systemd/blob/ev3dev-jessie/scripts/ev3-usb.sh).
It looks like they have cracked this problem in 2017 or earlier!

I blended EV3 and Ben's configurations with my own additions. The resulting
configuration is little bit more complex, but it works on both Linux and Windows
with no additional changes, simultaneously supporting RNDIS and CDC-ECM USB
protocols. To spare myself (and possibly others) from replaying this
configuration in the future manually, I wrote a few automation
[scripts](https://github.com/ramblehead/rpi4-ethernet-over-usb). With these
scripts, to configure Raspberry Pi 4 to local Ethernet-over-USB gadget mode
execute the following commands in Pi terminal:

```shell
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/ramblehead/rpi4-ethernet-over-usb.git
$ cd rpi4-ethernet-over-usb
$ sudo ./setup-usb.sh
$ sudo ./setup-dnsmasq.sh
```

Then reboot Raspberry Pi *two times* and it should be ready to connect to any
host computer.

The above commands assume that Raspberry Pi is connected to the Internet to
access GitHub. If it is offline, use some other ways to copy
`rpi4-ethernet-over-usb` repository to your Raspberry Pi home directory.

The following figures are example screenshots of how correct configuration
should look like on Ubuntu:
