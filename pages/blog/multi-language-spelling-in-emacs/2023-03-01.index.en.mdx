## Priming

Despite finishing Russian school and getting my undergraduate degree in Russian,
my (fairly small) publishing experience consists mostly of English-language
writings. In my early days in academia my preferred text editor was Microsoft
Word. With some practice and discipline in Word one could achieve
content-presentation separation, consistent automatic styling and some degree of
automation, such as images and equations numbering or generating a table of
content. With certain additional software and plugins, the level of automation
could be increased further&nbsp;- such as automatic list of references or image
placement.

Although there are obvious advantages of Word (and other WYSIWYG editors), there
are strong reasons against using it. First, Word file format is complicated, not
human readable and evolving over time. It is nearly impossible to open a complex
Word document in any other editor and have its accurate visual representation.
Even the newer versions of Word occasionally fail to open a document created in
its previous version. Second, many scientific journal publishers used to provide
a better quality LaTeX templates than Word. And third, I find LaTeX-rendered
documents more visually appealing than Word documents.

Those reasons were sufficient for me to switch to LaTeX, accepting its steep
learning curve and tall entry barrier. After learning the basics I realised that
my usual then programming text editors were not well suited to edit prose text.
After trying many specialised LaTeX text editors I eventually converged to Emacs
mode called AUCTeX. That is how my Emacs adventure began that led me to
abandoning Visual Studio, then Windows and eventually moving to Linux.

## Motivation

Some people are said to have innate literacy&nbsp;- it must be the far right
side of some literacy distribution curve. My literacy should be somewhere at
another side of that curve&nbsp;- "innate illiteracy". Thus, after I had Emacs,
AUCTeX and MiKTeX running, I had to find a good way to spell-check my writings.
Something similar to the famous "Word's red squiggly line". Initially, I
configured Emacs ispell package with aspell driver. Although ispell was useful
for individual words checking, it felt too manual and retrograde in compare to
Word's squiggly lines that I used to.

However I do not remember details from that now distant past, for some reason I
could not get flyspell working and ended-up installing and configuring speck
with aspell instead. At that time I also tried and failed to configure
multi-language spellchecking. A separate Russian dictionary worked well with
aspell and not with speck. Possibly, I could not configure it correctly because
of my insufficient experience with ELisp and the lack of interest in getting it
working.

Many years after those events, by the time I started working on this website,
Emacs has became the editor of choice for all my text editing needs. Even more
recent advanced text editors such as Sublime and Visual Studio Code do not fit
my mindset as well as Emacs. Also, my ELisp confidence grew together with the
size of my `.config/emcacs/init.el` config file solidifying my faith in Emacs.

From the beginning I wanted my site to have full i18n support, allowing English
and Russian publications in the beginning and more languages in the future.
Unfortunately, over these years of practicing Emacs my innate literacy did not
become any better and I sill require a good spellchecker to tell me how I should
not write. Initial internet search revealed a Reddit post
[Spell checkers in Emacs in 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fxs92h/spell_checkers_in_emacs_in_2020/)
that was a good starting point.

## ispell with Hunspell

One of the replies in the Reddit post above created an impression that aspell
can use multiple languages in the same buffer. That reply refers to
[Using Multi Dictionaries](http://aspell.net/man-html/Using-Multi-Dictionaries.html)
subsection of the aspell man pages. My attempts to configure aspell to use
English and Russian dictionaries simultaneously in the same document have
failed. Further readings reviled that aspell can only use additional
dictionaries of the same language, such as a medical dictionary or a local
dialect.

There are ways to hack aspell to make it work with multiple dictionaries, such
as: using one language spellchecker output as an input to another one; or
concatenating different language dictionaries into one. There is a
[multiple languages in one file](https://github.com/GNUAspell/aspell/issues/448)
GitHub issue that goes into more details of those aspell hacking approaches and
their related problems. The conclusion is that aspell on its own is not an
optimal solution for multi-language documents spellchecking.

In the Reddit post mentioned above some commenters mentioned Hunspell as an
aspell alternative that can spellcheck multi-language buffers using multiple
dictionaries. In my further Emacs configuration I would like to use stock Emacs
packages as much as possible and reduce my reliance on 3rd parties packages.
Therefore, the first choices were ispell and flyspell.

It took me a while to figure out correct ispell config that works with Hunspell
backed. The
[blog post](https://200ok.ch/posts/2020-08-22_setting_up_spell_checking_with_multiple_dictionaries.html)
by Alain M. Lafon was the most useful starting point.

## Questions still unanswered

Fly/en - language indicator is not correct - should show all Hunspell dicts.

When ispell with Hunspell back-end is used, spellchecking a single word does not
produce correct result - either the language has to be manually switched or a
region selected.

Hunspell personal dictionary mixes words in different languages. There should be
a file per language instead.

Face filter has to be adviced - no good way to customise it.
