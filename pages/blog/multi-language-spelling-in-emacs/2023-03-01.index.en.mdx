Despite finishing Russian school and getting my undergraduate degree in Russian,
my (fairly small) publishing practice mostly consists of English-language
papers. In my early days in academia my preferred editor was Microsoft Word.
With practice and discipline in Word one could achieve content-presentation
separation, consistent automatic styling and a certain degree of automation,
such as image or equation numbering or generating table of content. With some
additional software and plugins, the level of automation could be even
higher&nbsp;- such as automatic references list or image placement.

Despite obvious advantages of Word (and other WYSIWYG editors), there are
reasons against using it. First, Word file format is complicated, not human
readable and evolving over time. It is nearly impossible to open a complex Word
document in some other editor and have its accurate visual representation. Even
the newer versions of Word occasionally fail to open a document created in its
previous version. Second, many scientific journals used to provide a better
quality LaTeX templates than Word. And third, I find LaTeX-rendered documents
more visually appealing than Word documents.

Those reasons were sufficient for me to switch to LaTeX despite its steep
learning curve and tall entry barrier. After learning the basics I realised that
my usual then programming text editors are not convenient to edit prose text.
After trying many specialised LaTeX text editors I eventually converged to Emacs
mode called AUCTeX. That is how my Emacs adventure began that led me to
abandoning Visual Studio, then Windows and eventually moving to Linux.

Some people are said to have innate literacy&nbsp;- it must be far right side of
some literacy distribution carve. My literacy should be somewhere at another
side of that carve&nbsp;- "innate illiteracy". Thus, after I had Emacs, AUCTeX
and MiKTeX running, I had to find a good way to spell-check my writings.
Something similar to Word's red squiggly line. Initially I configured Emacs
ispell package with aspell driver. However ispell was useful, it felt too manual
and retrograde in compare to Word's squiggly lines that I used to.

However I do not remember details from that now distant past, for some reason I
could not get flyspell working and ended-up using speck with aspell instead.
