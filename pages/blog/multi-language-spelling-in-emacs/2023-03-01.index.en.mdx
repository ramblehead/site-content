## Priming

Despite finishing Russian school and getting my undergraduate degree in Russian,
my (fairly small) publishing practice mostly consists of English-language
writings. In my early days in academia my preferred text editor was Microsoft
Word. With some practice and discipline in Word one could achieve
content-presentation separation, consistent automatic styling and a some degree
of automation, such as images and equations numbering or generating a table of
content. With certain additional software and plugins, the level of automation
could be increased further&nbsp;- such as automatic list of references or image
placement.

Although there are obvious advantages of Word (and other WYSIWYG editors), there
are strong reasons against using it. First, Word file format is complicated, not
human readable and evolving over time. It is nearly impossible to open a complex
Word document in any other editor and have its accurate visual representation.
Even the newer versions of Word occasionally fail to open a document created in
its previous version. Second, many scientific journal publishers used to provide
a better quality LaTeX templates than Word. And third, I find LaTeX-rendered
documents more visually appealing than Word documents.

Those reasons were sufficient for me to switch to LaTeX, accepting its steep
learning curve and tall entry barrier. After learning the basics I realised that
my usual then programming text editors were not well suited to edit prose text.
After trying many specialised LaTeX text editors I eventually converged to Emacs
mode called AUCTeX. That is how my Emacs adventure began that led me to
abandoning Visual Studio, then Windows and eventually moving to Linux.

## Motivation

Some people are said to have innate literacy&nbsp;- it must be the far right
side of some literacy distribution curve. My literacy should be somewhere at
another side of that curve&nbsp;- "innate ilhliteracy". Thus, after I had Emacs,
AUCTeX and MiKTeX running, I had to find a good way to spell-check my writings.
Something similar to famous "Word's red squiggly line". Initially, I configured
Emacs ispell package with aspell driver. Although ispell was useful for
individual words checking, it felt too manual and retrograde in compare to
Word's squiggly lines that I used to.

However I do not remember details from that now distant past, for some reason I
could not get flyspell working and ended-up installing and configuring speck
with aspell instead. At that time I also tried and failed to configure
multi-language spellchecking. A separate Russian dictionary worked well with
aspell and not with speck. Possibly, I could not configure it correctly because
of my insufficient experience with ELisp and the lack of interest in getting it
working.

Many years after those events, by the time I started working on this website,
Emacs has became the editor of choice for all my text editing needs. Even more
recent advanced text editors such as Sublime and Visual Studio Code do not fit
my mindset as well as Emacs. Also, my ELisp confidence grew together with the
size of my `.config/emcacs/init.el` config file solidifying my faith in Emacs.

From the beginning I wanted my site to have full i18n support, allowing English
and Russian publications in the beginning and more languages in the future.
Unfortunately, over these years of practicing Emacs my innate literacy did not
become any better and I sill require a good spellchecker to tell me how I should
not write. Initial internet search revealed a reddit post
[Spell checkers in Emacs in 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fxs92h/spell_checkers_in_emacs_in_2020/)
that was a good starting point.
