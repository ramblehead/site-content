## Handling local addresses

Add the following lines to `server` section in `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` to
resolve [artizanya.com](http://artizanya.com/) on local network from within NAT:

```yaml
local-zone: "artizanya.com." static
local-data: "artizanya.com. IN A 127.0.0.1"
```

To validate the Unbound configuration file:

```shell
$ unbound-checkconf /etc/unbound/unbound.conf
```

To restart Unbound service:

```shell
# systemctl restart unbound
```
