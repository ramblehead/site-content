  Local Ethernet-over-USB Raspberry Pi configuration, compatible with Windows
  (RNDIS) and other major operating systems (CDC-ECM).

When using Raspberry Pi 4 as an embedded system on a device, it is convenient to
use a web server as the device user interface. Modern browsers expose sufficient
functionality for web apps to perform on par with desktop and mobile
applications. This type of Web User Interface (WUI) deployment is particularly
attractive due to its unchallenged cross-platform compatibly, no installation
requirements and, potentially, zero configuration.

While Raspberry Pi 4 has Ethernet interface and it is fairly easy to configure
on TCP/IP networks, it might still be challenging for an end user to connect it
to their computer or an existing network. The recurring problem is the static IP
versus DHCP configuration.

If a device with embedded Raspberry Pi 4 is deployed using default DHCP client
configuration, the end user could expect it to work when connected directly to
the computer Ethernet port. It would, of course, fail as most personal computers
are also configured by default as DHCP clients.

A seemingly easy solution is to provide the end user with instructions of how to
configure their computer Ethernet adapter with a static IP address and also
configure embedded Raspberry Pi 4 with static IP. Such configuration should work
with direct connection between Raspberry Pi and end user
computer. Unfortunately, it would also fail when connecting to an existing
network with DHCP server.  Additionally, user's computer would no longer work
with networks that are running DHCP server.

Well, static IP addresses would work in *some* networks with DHCP server and
some more secure networks can be configured to allow certain static IP
addresses. That, however, only adds more complexity to already complex
configuration problem.

Another solution to this network configuration problem could be adding a small
display to Raspberry Pi with some buttons to switch between static and dynamic
IP address configurations, provide some connection diagnostics indicators and to
allow user to manually set custom static IP address. In many cases this solution
is less desirable as it increases device cost and complexity, and it is also no
longer zero-configuration device.

Yet another solution could be providing an Ethernet router along with the device
to allow end user computer and Raspberry Pi to be both configured as DHCP
clients. This might be a good solution if there are multiple devices that should
be connected to the network simultaneously, and if the devices are large and
expensive enough in compare to the size and cost of the router. In other cases,
this solution is less good. Additionally, routers require a separate power
supply.

One more solution could be connecting an additional Ethernet adapter to
Raspberry Pi as a USB dongle or a HAT. Then the native Ethernet port can be
configured as DHCP client and the external Ethernet as static IP. Thus, the
native Ethernet port can be connected to a network with DHCP server and the
external Ethernet port can be used to connect Raspberry Pi to end user
computer. Unfortunately, this solution would introduce an additional confusion -
which port is which, and it does not eliminate the need of end user computer
configuration with static IP address.

It seems that there is no good way of configuring Raspberry Pi 4 Ethernet
adapter as a mean to provide zero configuration device WUI to the end
user. Alternative approach could be to use USB interface for direct computer
connection and to reserve Ethernet for networks with DHCP server.

In order to access device WUI via USB, the USB driver should support some kind
of Ethernet-over-USB bridging. Linux kernel
[supports](https://docs.kernel.org/usb/gadget_configfs.html) such capability,
known as "USB gadget", for more than a decade. A brief internet search revivals
that some more recent Raspberry Pi devices allow such USB configuration -
including Raspberry Pi 4. Many internet forums and posts seem to suggest
configuration that was originally
[used](https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget)
on Pi Zero devices. On Pi 4, it should be used with USB-C port that is also
normally used for power. This configuration is very simple:

* On Pi 4, add `dtoverlay=dwc2` line to the end of `/boot/config.txt` file.
* Add `modules-load=dwc2,g_ether` string after `rootwait` in
  `/boot/cmdline.txt`.

Unfortunately, on my Ubuntu 22.04 LTS systems it only works with "Direct Link
Enabled":

Windows 10 and Windows 11 recognise such USB configuration as COM port:

Further internet search has revealed an excellent [blog
post](https://github.com/ramblehead/rpi4-ethernet-over-usb/tree/main) by Ben
Hardill. The configuration Ben proposes is more involved, but it demonstrates
how to setup kernel's `usb_gadget`, including USB device descriptor, from shell
and how DHCP server can be used at Raspberry Pi side, so the host computer does
not require setting IP address manually. Ben's configuration works perfectly
well on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Windows 10 and Windows 11 is still recognise it as a
COM port.

Unfortunately, Windows support is important. Also, I would prefer to have
`systemd` configuration over using `/etc/rc.local`. So, I started working on my
own solution based on Ben's work. Further Windows-specific internet search has
revealed
[this](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/netchip-rndisethernet-gadget-not-detected-on/9dfdd348-f503-47be-9c72-87736fb771a6)
and
[that](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-10-vs-remote-ndis-ethernet-usbgadget-not/cb30520a-753c-4219-b908-ad3d45590447)
threads on Microsoft answers forum. Reading those forums led me to another
brilliant project from LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 community:
[ev3-systemd](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3-systemd/blob/ev3dev-jessie/scripts/ev3-usb.sh). It
looks like they cracked this problem in 2017 or earlier!

I blended EV3 and Ben's configs with my own additions. The resulting
configuration is little bit more complex, but it works on Linux and Windows with
no additional changes, supporting both RNDIS and CDC-ECM USB protocols. To spare
myself (and possibly others) from replaying this configuration in the future
manually, I wrote a few automation
[scripts](https://github.com/ramblehead/rpi4-ethernet-over-usb). With these
scripts, to configure Raspberry Pi 4 to local Ethernet-over-USB gadget mode
execute the following commands in Pi terminal:

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/ramblehead/rpi4-ethernet-over-usb.git
cd rpi4-ethernet-over-usb
sudo ./setup-usb.sh
sudo ./setup-dnsmasq.sh
```

Then reboot Raspberry Pi two times and it should be ready to connect to any host
computer.

The above commands assume that Raspberry Pi is connected to the Internet to
access GitHub. If it is offline, use some other ways to copy
`rpi4-ethernet-over-usb` repository to your Raspberry Pi home directory.

If you tested this configuration on other host platforms or have some comments
or suggestions, feel free to share them below. Any bug reports or requests
regarding automations scripts should be, preferably, reported at GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/ramblehead/rpi4-ethernet-over-usb/issues)
