## Why Dynamic DNS

Dynamic DNS is useful when ISP is providing public IP address with the address
value allocated dynamically via DHCP. In such configuration, IP address may
change when, for example, ISP router resets.

Thus, although devices at IP address dynamically allocated by ISP are accessible
from the Internet, their address is not stable and may change at any time to
some unpredictable values.

Dynamic DNS allows binding a stable DNS host name with a dynamic IP
address. When dynamic IP address changes, Dynamic DNS service updates DNS record
to the new IP address value.

## “Dynamic DNS” abbreviations

Dynamic DNS term is often abbreviated as DDNS. In the current post this
abbreviation is intentionally avoided as it is also used for Decentralised DNS
that is a completely different technology. Another term that is often used in
DynDNS. Unfortunately DynDNS is also a name of a particular Dynamic DNS service
provider. Therefore the full _Dynamic DNS_ term is used here instead of its
ambiguous abbreviated variants.

## How it works

Dynamic DNS service provides an API to update DNS record in real time as host IP
address changes.

The client connected to dynamic IP address is responsible for updating its DNS
records using Dynamic DNS service API.

The client can find its IP address from its network driver if it is connected
directly to ISP, or by querying an external server if it is connected via router
NAT (e.g. typing “what is my IP” in Google prompt).

## Dynamic DNS client software

There are three main options of Dynamic DNS client software:
* Embedded router software
* Manually installed application or service on any modern OS
* Custom script

### Embedded Router Software

The simplest approach is to use embedded router software. Dynamic DNS APIs are
not standard and a typical router software has a limited number of the supported
Dynamic DNS providers. Use router software approach if it supports required
Dynamic DNS provider.

The following figure shows an example of the router Dynamic DNS software
configuration page:

### Manually Installed Application

Many Dynamic DNS service providers also provide a client application responsible
for DNS records updates. Most such software are propriety and closed-source.

Two popular open source packages of Dynamic DNS client software are:

* [ddclient](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient)
* [Small and Simple DDNS Client](https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn)
* [dnsupdate](https://github.com/lopsided98/dnsupdate)

`ddclient` is included in Debian distributive and its derivative such as
Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu.

#### ddclient installation and configuration

On Debian systems `ddclient` can be installed with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install ddclient
# as of writing, current ddclient version is 3.9.1
```

When running above apt command, the installer should run the following sequence
of configuration windows:

    className="!rounded-none"

    alt=""
    className="!rounded-none"
    priority
  />

  </figcaption>

The resulting configuration files is located at `/etc/ddclient.conf`.

#### Dynamic DNS services supported by ddclient

The following services are supported directly via configuration dialogue:

* https://no-ip.com/
* https://freedns.afraid.org/
* https://www.duckdns.org/
* https://www.dyndns.com/
* https://www.easydns.com/
* https://www.dslreports.com/
* https://www.zoneedit.com/

Regarding Google Domains&nbsp;– as of writing this article, already registered
domains are still working. However, on September 7, 2023, Squarespace acquired
all domain registrations and related customer accounts from Google
Domains. Customers and domains will be transitioned over the next few months. It
is still uncertain if Squarespace is going to offer a Dynamic DNS service and
keep prices reasonable.

There are many other [services
supported](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient#supported-services). See
[configuration documentation](https://ddclient.net/#configuration) for further
details.

### Custom script

The last and the most flexible option is to manually implement Dynamic DNS
client script. The following repository is an example of a such script in Python
for porkbun DNS service:
