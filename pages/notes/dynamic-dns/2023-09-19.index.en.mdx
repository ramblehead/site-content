## Why Dynamic DNS

Dynamic DNS is useful when ISP is providing public IP address with the address
value allocated dynamically via DHCP. In such configuration, IP address may
change when, for example, ISP router resets.

Thus, although devices at IP address dynamically allocated by ISP are accessible
from the Internet, their address is not stable and may change at any time to
unpredictable values.

Dynamic DNS allows binding a stable DNS host name with a dynamic IP
address. When dynamic IP address changes, Dynamic DNS service updates DNS record
to the new IP address value.

## Dynamic DNS abbreviations

Dynamic DNS is often abbreviated as DDNS. In this note I am intentionally
avoiding this abbreviation as it is also used for Decentralised DNS that is a
completely different technology. Another term that is often used in
DynDNS. Unfortunately DynDNS is also a name of a particular Dynamic DNS service
provider. Therefore the full _Dynamic DNS_ name is used here instead of its
ambiguous abbreviated variants.

## How it works

Dynamic DNS service provides an API to update DNS record in real time as host IP
address changes.

The client connected to dynamic IP address is responsible for updating its DNS
records using Dynamic DNS service API.

The client can find its IP address from its network driver if it is connected
directly to ISP, or by queering an external server if it is connected via router
NAT (e.g. typing "what is my IP" in Google prompt).

## Dynamic DNS client software

There are three main options of Dynamic DNS client software:
* Embedded router software
* Manually installed application or service on any modern OS
* Custom script

### Embedded Router Software

The simplest approach is to use embedded router software. Dynamic DNS APIs are
not standard and router software has limited number of the supported Dynamic DNS
providers. Use router approach if it supports utilised Dynamic DNS provider.

### Manually Installed Application

Many Dynamic DNS service providers also provide a client application responsible
for DNS records updates. Most such software are propriety and closed-source.

Tow popular open source packages of Dynamic DNS client software are:

* [ddclient](https://ddclient.net/)
* [Small and Simple DDNS Client](https://troglobit.com/projects/inadyn/)

sudo apt install ddclient

Regarding Google Domains, as of writing this article, already existing domains
still work. However, on September 7, 2023, Squarespace acquired all domain
registrations and related customer accounts from Google Domains. Customers and
domains will be transitioned over the next few months. It is still uncertain if
Squarespace is going to offer a Dynamic DNS service.
