## Installing Poetry on Linux

### Manual User-Local Installation via `pip` with `venv`

This installation process is tested in Ubuntu 22.04 Linux distributive.

Ensure base Python installation via `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt install python python-is-python3 python3-venv
```

Install poetry in a dedicated `venv`:

```bash
VENV_PATH=~/.local/share/pypoetry/venv
python -m venv $VENV_PATH
$VENV_PATH/bin/pip install -U pip setuptools
$VENV_PATH/bin/pip install poetry
```

Symlink installed `poetry` to a local `bin` directory:

```bash
ln -vs $VENV_PATH/bin/poetry ~/.local/bin
```

Test new `poerty` installation:

```bash
poetry --version
# expected output example:
# Poetry (version 1.4.2)
```

Enable `bash` tab completion:

```bash
poetry completions bash >> ~/.bash_completion
```

### VS Code Integration with `venv` of `poetry` Projects

1. Open terminal, navigate to the root directory of `poetry` project and
   activate `poetry` environment by running `poetry shell`
1. Notice virtual env path in terminal output
1. Open the command palette in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, run
   `Python: Select Interpreter` and select "Enter interpreter path..."
1. Navigate to the virtual env path and select `python` file
1. Current Python environment should be shown in the bottom right corner of VS
   Code window.
