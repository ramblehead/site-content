### Small changes and additions

#### &#9744; Links mouse-in and mouse-out animation

#### &#9744; Ensure that dates in Blog and Notes do not wrap on small screens

#### &#9744; Hash links for page MDX headings

These are also known as [hash anchors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#linking_to_an_element_on_the_same_page).

<p />

### More involved changes and improvements

#### &#9744; Make src path relative to the containing mdx file dir

For example, if mdx file dir is `blog/how-i-ended-up-here`, then currently its
`src` is `/static/blog/how-i-ended-up-here/front-end-doom.jpg`.

Instead, `src` should be `./static/front-end-doom.jpg` and a custom rehype
pluggin (rehypeImgSize -> rehypeImg?) should update it to
`/static/blog/how-i-ended-up-here/front-end-doom.jpg`
