### Small changes and additions

#### &#9744; Links mouse-in and mouse-out animation

#### &#9744; Add global languages to rehypeHighlight

Currenly the used languages should be specifyed per-page. If globla languages
are not possible in rehypeHighlight, then create a single module that exports
all used languages.

#### &#9744; Ensure that dates in Blog and Notes do not wrap on small screens

#### &#9744; Hash links for page MDX headings

These are also known as
[hash anchors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#linking_to_an_element_on_the_same_page).

<p />

### More involved changes and improvements

#### &#9744; Make src path relative to the containing mdx file dir

For example, if mdx file dir is `blog/how-i-ended-up-here`, then currently its
`src` is `/static/blog/how-i-ended-up-here/front-end-doom.jpg`.

Instead, `src` should be `./static/front-end-doom.jpg` and a custom rehype
pluggin (rehypeImgSize -> rehypeImg?) should update it to
`/static/blog/how-i-ended-up-here/front-end-doom.jpg`

#### &#9744; SEO

https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo

#### &#9744; Modal images on click

It should be possible to click on images and open then in full size modal window
and original format - i.e. without using Next.js Image component.

#### &#9744; Add site about page

Should be something similar to [nextra about](https://nextra.site/about)

### Longer and complex investigations

#### &#9744; Use @next/font

https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/font<br />
https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization

#### &#9744; PWA

https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa

#### &#9744; Analytics

https://splitbee.io/

#### &#9745; Add comments and reactions to blog posts

https://giscus.app/

#### &#9745; Replace Styled Components with Module SCSS and Tailwind

#### &#9744; Add Site-Wide Search

https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch

### Further Research

#### &#9744; Adobe React Aria based mobile menu

https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useDialog.html

#### &#9744; URL validator

Find how to automatically check that all site-refferenced resources are alive
and valid.

#### &#9744; Investigate other language highlighting engines

Possible options are:

* [Rehype Pretty Code](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) (based on [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki))
* [remark-prism](https://github.com/sergioramos/remark-prism) (based on [Prism](https://prismjs.com/))
