### Small changes and additions

#### &#9744; Links mouse-in and mouse-out animation

<p />

### More involved changes and improvements

#### &#9744; Make src path relative to the containing mdx file dir

For example, if mdx file dir is `blog/how-i-ended-up-here`, then currently its
`src` is `/static/blog/how-i-ended-up-here/front-end-doom.jpg`.

Instead, `src` should be `./static/front-end-doom.jpg` and a custom rehype
pluggin (rehypeImgSize -> rehypeImg?) should update it to
`/static/blog/how-i-ended-up-here/front-end-doom.jpg`

### Longer and complex investigations

#### &#9744; Replace Styled Components with Module SCSS and Tailwind

<p />

#### &#9744; Use @next/font
