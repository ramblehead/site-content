### Ubuntu 22.04 Samba Server Home Directory Permission Issue

In previous versions of Ubuntu, the userâ€™s home directory permission was set to
`755`, which allowed other users to view the directory as well as the containing
files and sub-directories. To avoid such a security issue, the home directories
permission has been changed to `750`, which means only the owner of the home
directory can view the contents.

This change of policy causes an issue with public (anonymous) Samba-shared
folders within home directories. Even if `public = yes` parameter is used, only
the owner of the home directory can see the share.

#### Reverting Home Directory Permission Solution

```bash
chmod o+rx /home/{USER}
```

#### Reverting Home Directory Permission Solution

Add shared folders with either private access or using `force user = {USER}`
parameter to `/etc/samba/smb.conf` as in the following example:

```toml
[io]
  path = /home/rh/io
  guest ok = no
  read only = no
  browseable = yes
  valid users = @rh

[homes]
  comment = Home Directories
  browseable = yes
  read only = no
  create mask = 0700
  directory mask = 0700
  valid users = %S

[Public]
  path = /home/rh/Public
  guest ok = yes
  guest only = yes
  browsable = yes
  read only = yes
  force create mode = 0666
  force directory mode = 0777
  force user = rh
```

### mDNS Names Resolution Issue in Windows 10+

Since version 10, Windows OS supports mDNS out-of-the-box. However, SMB service
access by mDNS name seems to only work partially. Thus, on the following
screenshot the folder browsing works as expected (`rhc-krancher` is
mDNS-resolved name):

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/static/notes/linux-samba/network-folder-mdns-name.png"
    alt=""
    className={null}
    priority
  />
  <figcaption>
    <>Network Folder Showing mDNS Host Name</>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

while attempts to open non-public shared folders fail with the following
message:

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/static/notes/linux-samba/open-folder-mdns-error.png"
    alt=""
    className={null}
    priority
  />
  <figcaption>
    <>Open Folder mDNS Error in Windows 10</>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

#### NetBIOS Aliases Solution

The following parameter can be added to `/etc/samba/smb.conf` to enable NetBIOS
aliases in Samba:

```toml
netbios aliases = hostname, secondname, thirdname
```

### Some Useful Hints on Samba

#### Testing `/etc/samba/smb.conf` for correctness

```bash
testparm
```

#### Restarting Samba Server on Ubuntu

Presumably, it should work other `systemd` GNU/Linux variants:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd nmbd
```

#### Adding User to `sambashare` Group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sambashare {USER}
```

#### Changing Samba User Password

```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a {USER}
```

#### Enforcing SMB Protocol Version

Depending on the SMB client used, default Samba SMB protocol may or may not
work. `client protocol` parameters family in `/etc/samba/smb.conf` could be used
to enforce specific protocol version or versions range, for example:

```toml
client min protocol = SMB2_10
client max protocol = SMB3
client protocol = SMB3
# client max protocol = SMB2_10
# client protocol = SMB2_10
# client protocol = SMB3_11
```

#### Disconnecting Stalled Shared Folders in Windows Clients

```powershell
net use \\rhc-krancher\io /delete
net use
Get-SmbServerConfiguration | Select EnableSMB3Protocol
```
