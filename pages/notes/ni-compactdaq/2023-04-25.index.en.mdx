## Linux

### Drivers and Software

Download
[NI-DAQmx Linux installer](https://www.ni.com/en-gb/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#480886).
This zip archive contains `ni-ubuntu*-drivers-*.deb` packages for a few Linux
distributives, including the latest versions of Ubuntu:<br/>

- `ni-ubuntu*-drivers-stream.deb` is the most up-to-date release.
- `ni-ubuntu*-drivers-*Q?.deb` is the current snapshot release.

To check Ubuntu version from CLI:

```bash
lsb_release -a
```

Installing one of those deb packages adds apt ppa list for National Instruments
software that can be then installed with `apt install` commands:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i <ni-ubuntu*-drivers-*.deb>
sudo apt update

sudo apt install ni-daqmx ni-daqmx-cdaq-firmware

# This can only be used in GUI environemts
sudo apt install ni-hwcfg-utility

sudo dkms autoinstall
sudo reboot
```

Linux software does not include NI MAX GUI that is included in Windows software.
Instead, use `ni-hwcfg-utility` for GUI and `nidaqmxconfig` for CLI, as
explained in this
[NI support thread](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z0000019Y2XSAU&l=en-GB).

### Getting NI DAQ lines and terminals from CLI

The following are Linux CLI utilities could be used to identify and configure NI
DAQ devices recognised by the system `nipxiconfig`, `nidaqmxconfig`, `nilsdev`.

Unfortunately, non of the above utilities allow listing available device ports,
lines and terminals (PFIs). Small Python scripts can be used to obtain such
information:

```python
import nidaqmx

# replace with your device name
device_name = "cDAQ1Mod2"
device = nidaqmx.system.Device(device_name)

# Print all digital input lines
for di in device.di_lines:
    print(di.name)

# Print all terminals (PFIs)
for terminal in device.terminals:
    print(terminal)
```
