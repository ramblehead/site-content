## Linux

### Drivers and Software

Download
[NI-DAQmx Linux installer](https://www.ni.com/en-gb/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#480886).
This zip archive contains `ni-ubuntu*-drivers-*.deb` packages for a few Linux
distributives, including the latest versions of Ubuntu:<br/>

- `ni-ubuntu*-drivers-stream.deb` is the most up-to-date release.
- `ni-ubuntu*-drivers-*Q?.deb` is the current snapshot release.

Installing one of those deb packages adds apt ppa list for National Instruments
software that can be then installed with `apt install` commands:

```bash
sudo apt install ni-daqmx ni-hwcfg-utility ni-daqmx-cdaq-firmware
sudo dkms autoinstall
sudo reboot
```

Linux software does not include NI MAX GUI that is included in Windows software.
Use `ni-hwcfg-utility` instead, as explained in this
[NI support thread](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z0000019Y2XSAU&l=en-GB).
