## Reverse Proxy Options

The following reverse proxy options seem to be the most popular:

* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)
* [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) (pronounced "Engine X")
* [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
* [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/)
* [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/)


Apache is the oldest and the most customisable web server.

Nginx is a bit younger than Apache, also very customisable and has better
performance and memory footprint than Apache.

Caddy is younger than both Apache and Nginx and the most user-friendly.

All above solutions are web servers that can also be used as reverse proxies or
load balancers.

HAProxy and Envoy are load balancers that can also be used as reverse proxies.

HAProxy is advertised as the fastest possible solution that outperforms Nginx.

Envoy supports gRPC requests via REST API (HTTP 1.1).

In my experience I only used Apache and Caddy. All above statements are my
conclusions derived from various internet forums and blog posts.

Currently, for my self-hosted projects I use Caddy - mostly because is has the
simplest HTTPS configuration I have seen.

There are also some posts suggesting to use [Nginx Proxy
Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) (aka NPM) to simplify Nginx
configuration on-par with Caddy.
