# Installing on Linux

## Missing Python Error

During PlatformIO installation as VS Code Extension on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS,
the installer complains that python is missing&nbsp;â€“ even if it is installed
via apt. What PlatformIO actually wants is Python venv:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

## Failing Firmware Upload

After fresh installation, PlatformIO fails to upload firmware to Arduino SAM
boards. According to
[99-platformio-udev.rules](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/core/installation/udev-rules.html)
this happens due to unrecognised Arduino USB device PID and VID. To install udev
rules for PlatformIO supported boards/devices, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core/develop/platformio/assets/system/99-platformio-udev.rules | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-platformio-udev.rules
```
