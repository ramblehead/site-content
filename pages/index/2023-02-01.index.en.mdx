# Greetings, stranger!

My name is Victor Rybynok. I am R&D Software Engineer&nbsp;– mostly developing
embedded software for distributed real time systems with automatic control and
web user interfaces.

This website site is a collection of blog posts and notes, and the place where I
can keep my thoughts organised, searchable and shared with the rest of the
world&nbsp;– my space in [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere).

It is also a test platform where I can experiment with web software development
and deployment techniques and document small discoveries that I find
interesting.
