# Greetings, stranger!

My name is Victor Rybynok. I am R&D Software Engineer&nbsp;– mostly developing
embedded Linux software for distributed real time systems with automatic control
and web user interfaces.

{/*
My current working programming languages are C++20, TypeScript, and Python. I am
also interested in Rust, cppfront, Go, and Haskell. Throughout my career, I have
used over two dozen general-purpose and domain-specific languages.
*/}

This website site is a collection of blog posts and notes, and the place where I
can keep my thoughts organised, searchable and shared with the rest of the
world&nbsp;– my space in [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere).

It is also a test platform where I can experiment with web software development
and deployment techniques and document small discoveries that I find
interesting.
