# My Digital Frontier

My name is Victor Rybynok, a Senior Software Engineer working on software for
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems.

{/*
Join me as I explore the fascinating world of quantum technology, share insights
from my professional journey, and discuss the latest advancements in QKD and
cybersecurity.

This site is a collection of blog posts and notes, and the place where I can
keep my thoughts organised, searchable and shared with the rest of the
world&nbsp;â€“ my space in [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere).

It also serves as a test platform for experimenting with web software
development and deployment techniques, documenting the small discoveries I find
interesting.
