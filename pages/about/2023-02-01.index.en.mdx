I prefer not to disclose certain types of information about myself, my family,
or my friends on public internet resources. Therefore, on this page, I will not
provide details of my current employer or location beyond my country of
residence. If you require additional information or my full CV, please contact
me directly via email at v.rybynok@gmail.com.

One of my earliest childhood memories, from when I was perhaps 3 or 4 years old,
is of helping my father build a light organ box. This was during the time of the
late Soviet Union, where it was difficult to obtain such devices from
electronics shops. My father explained to me what transistors, cascading
amplifiers, and frequency filters were, as well as how to use lacquers to color
incandescent light bulbs. All are still relevant today. Except, colouring
incandescent bulbs - one, would, likely use LED lights for that purpose these
days!

My grandfather was the director of a factory that produced TV sets back in 80th.
He always had some latest cool gadgets in his house, such as
[first personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravetz_computers) and
[TV game consoles](https://ru.wikibooks.org/wiki/Советские_телевизионные_игровые_приставки/Фабричные_телеигры).
I used to visit my grandparents during almost every school holiday, and it was
during these visits that I became fascinated with computers. These electronic
machines soon became my passion, my profession, and a lifestyle.

My native language is Russian and when I first started using computers I did not
even know how to read Latin alphabet. Yet, I had a concept of computer program
and [Pravetz 8D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oric#Clones) computer manual in
English with examples written in BASIC. I began by coping examples into REPL
console and translating the manual into Russian with a dictionary, word-by-word.
Since I did not know how to pronounce English words correctly I invented my own
pronunciation&nbsp;– some of those words still linger in my accent even after
more than 20 years of living in the UK!

I completed my studies at a physics and mathematics specialized school in Moscow
in 1996, after which I enrolled at the National Research University of
Electronic Technology [MIET](https://eng.miet.ru/), Faculty of Microelectronics
and Technical Cybernetics. My aspirations were to become a computer games
developer. However, at the time there were no specific courses for this field in
Russian universities. As a result, I picked a more general specialisation -
Computer Systems and Networks.
