I prefer to avoid disclosing certain type of information about my self, my
family or friends on the public internet resources. As such, on this page I
would not include my current employer or location beyond the country of
residence. If for some reason you require that information, please contact me
directly via email - v.rybynok@gmail.com

One of my first childhood memories, perhaps from an age of 3 or 4, is helping my
father building a light music box back in the days of Soviet Union where it was
hard to get such devices from the electronics shops. My father explained to me
what are transistors, cascading amplifiers and frequency filters, and how to use
lacquers to colour incandescent light bulbs - all are still relevant today.
Except, colouring incandescent bulbs - one, would, likely use LED lights for
that purpose these days.

My grandfather was a director of a factory that produced TV sets back in 80th.
He always had some cool gadgets in his house, such as
[first personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravetz_computers) and
[TV game consoles](https://ru.wikibooks.org/wiki/Советские_телевизионные_игровые_приставки/Фабричные_телеигры).
I visited my grandparents nearly every school holiday. That is when I became
fascinated with computers - the electronic machines that later became my
passion, profession and the lifestyle.
